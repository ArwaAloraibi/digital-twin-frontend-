## Frontend (digital-twin-frontend):
A React-based web dashboard that allows authenticated users to monitor the simulated digital twin in real time. The frontend visualizes temperature trend, displays the current machine efficiency status, power consumed, error rate, efficiency and shows alerts generated by the backend to support predictive maintenance and system evaluation.

### Technologies:
⦁	React (jsx) </br>
⦁	Fetch API (to get backend data)

### Future Enhancements:
- Add a pi chart to visualize the efficiency
- Add another machines to monitor
- Calculate how much energy the machine uses under different conditions
